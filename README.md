Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women and men globally. Breast cancer arises when cells in the breast start to develop abnormally. Due to this cancer, there is a huge number of deaths every year. It is the most common type of all cancers and also the main cause of womenâ€™s death worldwide.

Nowadays Classification and data mining methods are very effective ways to classify data. Especially when we talk about the medical field, wherewith the help of machine learning we use to diagnose the disease and analysis also to make particular decisions.

So with the help of Machine learning if we can classify the patient having which type of cancer, then it will be easy for doctors to provide timely treatment to patients and improve the chance of survival.

About Breast Cancer Classification Project:
In this Machine learning project we are going to analyze and classify Breast Cancer (that the breast cancer belongs to which category), as basically there are two categories of breast cancer that is:
